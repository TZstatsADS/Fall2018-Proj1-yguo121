This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: What made you happy today?
+ This project is conducted by Yaoqi Guo, yg2542.

+ Project summary: HappyDB is a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Wordclouds are used to visualize these most frequent words, from which we hope to find important ones that make people of diffent groups happy.
